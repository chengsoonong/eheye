# Quantile Bandits for Best Arms Identification with Concentration Inequalities

This folder includes two subfolders:

* codes: 
    - Environment: implements the bandit environments (arm reward distributions)
    - Q_BAI: BAI algorithms (for both mean and quantiles), including Q-SAR and baseline algorithms
    - SimulatedGames: Simulate experiments
    - plots: plot result

* notebooks:
    - Group One Simulation (Fig 3 first row)
    - Group Two Simulation (Fig 3 second row)
    - Vaccine Simulation (Fig 5)
