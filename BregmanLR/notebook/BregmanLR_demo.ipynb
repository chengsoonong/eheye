In the other datasets however our implementations of the Bregman versions perform consistently worse than the standard versions, with up to a 10% decrease in prediction accuracy (as seen with the unregularized Ionosphere results).\n",
    "\n",
    "It is difficult to completely understand where these differences have come from, as we could not always set all analogous choices to be the same in the algorithms so that we could more directly compare them. For example, the regularization in the Lasso (LR+L1) model is the Tikonov variant, whereas the Bregman LR+L1 algorithm performs Ivanov regularization. Further, this Ivanov regularization parameter in the Bregman LR+L1 algorithm, as well as the number of iterations, could not be set completely freely - the optimization package CVXPY runs into convergences issues if these are altered to bad values. For the Bregman LR algorithm, we encountered an edge case not explicitly mentioned in the paper by Collins, Schapire and Singer where certain weights may need to be adjusted by -inf or +inf. At first we tried simply add or substract a large number in these cases, however if the number of iterations became too large these weights became np.nan and this would flow through our results. Thus, we were somewhat artifically limited in the number of iterations we could perform by this. "
