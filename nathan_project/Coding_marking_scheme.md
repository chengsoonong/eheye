15% Marks of Nathan's project is coding. 
Here are 5 aspects of the coding marking scheme:
- Reproducible workflow (with a readme clearly specifying the order to run Jupyter notebooks), that generates intermediate and final results [1,2].
- Readability: proper comments and naming so that the code can be understood by others [2].
- Data management: version control, results/plots management (re-producible plots, well-organised results), meeting notes/reports [2,3].
- Modularize your code (Do not Repeat Yourself), refer to Rule 4 in [1].
- Evidence of incremental and defensive software development, refer to Rule 2 in [1].
