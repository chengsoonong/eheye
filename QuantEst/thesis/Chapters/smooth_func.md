1. pinball loss
   1. explain pinball loss: math function and the picture.
   2. show the non-smoothness
2. The sqrt(x^2 + $\mu$)
3. The smooth function for |x|
4. (Optional) the thing derived from chapter 7
5. discussion:
   1. comparison between the smooth functions
        - how close it is to the absolute function: copy from the paper
        - smoothness but convex?
        - impossible to be smooth, convex and cross the (0,0) point
        - Is it okay to not use smooth function?
