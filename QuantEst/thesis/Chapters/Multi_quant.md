Two potential solutions for it
    - description, experiment, analysis, comparison & conclusion

Introduction
- multi-quant estimation: Introduce the relationship between quantiles into simultaneously estimate a set of quantiles.
- The information we didn't use: q1 < ... < qK
- Problem: quantile crossing (impossible)
- Solution: force positive distances between adjacent quantiles
