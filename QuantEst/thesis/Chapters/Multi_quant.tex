\chapter{Simultaneous Multiple Quantile Estimation}
\label{ch: multi_quant}

\graphicspath{{Figures/Multi/}{./}} 

When the estimation for only a single quantile value is not enough, the idea of multi-quantile estimation appears. 
In this chapter we introduce the problem of simultaneous multi-quantile estimation along with two related methods. This chapter is organised as follow:

Section~\ref{sec: multi_intro} introduces the multi-quantile estimation for streaming data, followed by a discussion on the basic ideas to attack this problem. The next two sections will show how it is solved by methods focusing on different aspects.

Section~\ref{sec: multi_shiftQ} shows the \textit{shiftQ} algorithm for simultaneous quantile estimation by implementing the idea similar to SGD.

Section~\ref{sec: multi_{p2}} shows the \textit{$P^2$} algorithm that solves the problem in a much different way.

Section~\ref{sec: multi_discussion} list the comparison between the two methods, the discussion about the problem and our conclusion.

\section{The problem and opportunity of multi-quantile estimation}
\label{sec: multi_intro}

In real life implementations, quantile estimation usually do not focus on a single quantile value. For example, a common request is to show the median (the $0.5$-quantile) of the distribution, and at the same time show the outlier boundaries at ends of the distribution, like the $0.1$- and $0.9$- quantiles. It is also highly possible that more quantile estimates are required for the data distribution analysis.

Under this circumstance, the estimation of multiple different quantiles also 

\section{The shiftQ methods}
\label{sec: multi_shiftQ}

\subsection{Method Description}

1. \textbf{Overall}: The basic idea is to estimate a central quantile point, and update other quantiles based on the central one. 

2. \textbf{Motivation}: The difference $diff$ between the two quantiles for the $x_{n}$ observation is:
$$
diff = |Q_x(q_{k+1}) - Q_x(q_k)|
$$
    Note that $diff > 0$ for all time, so different quantiles never cross each other. This property is guaranteed by the update function DUMIQE() and its restriction that the input quantile estimate must > 0.

3. \textbf{Update one quantile}: The difference is calculated based on the idea of "shift distribution". Let $X$ denotes the original distribution of data stream, and let distribution $Y$ denotes a shifted version of $X$ such that $Y = X + constant$. In this way, the quantile $q_{k+1}$ can be updated by implementation of shifting. The basic steps are:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Calculate $Q_x(q_k)$, which is the shift constant
    \item Get shift observation $y_{k+1} =  Q_x(q_k) - x$
    \item Calculate the new quantile $Q_y(q_{k+1})$ in $Y$
    \item Shift the change back to $X$: $Q_x(q_{k+1}) = Q_y(q_{k+1}) + shiftConstant$
\end{itemize}

4. \textbf{Update the bigger quantiles:} Starting from central quantile $q_c$, the estimates for $q_{c+1}, ..., q_{K}$ are calculated one based on another. So each time step 2 is repeated from $q_c$ to $q_{K-1}$

5. \textbf{Update the smaller quantiles:} Similar to step 3, for smaller quantiles, estimates for $q_{c-1}, ..., q_{1}$ are calculated similarly one based on another.
