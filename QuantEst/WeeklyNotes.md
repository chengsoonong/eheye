### Week10 meeting: todo in the next week

1. Last week's work:
    - Finish ploting and result comparing: plot all the charts, and store them in a folder for later comparison.
    - Add useful information in the file. e.g. The distribution charts.
    - Compare the charts and see which one is clearer
    
2. Q_init_computed comparison
    - Anylise them differently
    - for the ROUGH part:
        - batch to get q_init from N_init datapoints
        - relation between N_init and P(q_init \in A)
        - Markov's inequality
        
3. Next week: write down the questions, and try to clarify the questions

4. Remember to get a bit prepared for future explanations: write them down in advance
